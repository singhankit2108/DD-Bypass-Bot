<p><strong>Powerful Telegram automation</strong> for bypassing shorteners and extracting direct links.<br/>Get usable links, metadata, and media in a single reply.</p>

</div>

## Overview

Short links, scattered hosting pages, and manual downloads waste time. DD Bypass Bot automates link bypassing, direct-link generation, media extraction, thumbnail editing, and metadata retrieval. Send a link or media, get clean outputs back.

> Status: This repository documents the bot and its setup. Code and implementation details may evolve; site-specific scrapers often require ongoing maintenance due to frequent changes and anti-bot protections.

## Features

- Bypass shortener sites
	- Automatically resolve common shorteners into target URLs (best-effort, including Cloudflare challenges).
	- Example: `/bypass short.ly/abc123` → `https://example.com/file.zip`.

- Direct download links from sharers & file hosts
	- Convert share pages into direct-download URLs when possible.
	- Example: `/bypass sharehost.com/file/XYZ` → `https://cdn.sharehost.com/files/XYZ/download`.

- Telegram media extraction
	- Produce mediainfo, short sample clips, screenshots, and direct file links for Telegram-hosted files.
	- Example: send a video → click the action button → Mediainfo: H.264 1080p; Sample: `sample.mp4`.

- Thumbnail and cover extraction/replacement
	- Extract existing thumbnails/covers or set new ones for replied files.
	- Example: `/cover` or `/extract_thumb <reply> <image|url>` → bot replaces thumbnail and confirms.

- Direct image links
	- Generate stable direct links for images hosted on various platforms.
	- Example: `/paste <reply to photo or link>` → `https://cdn.imagepage.com/abc.jpg`.

- YouTube direct downloads (yt-dlp)
	- Produce direct downloadable streams or container links via yt-dlp.
	- Example: `/yt https://youtu.be/abc` → outputs `best-audio.mp4` and/or stream URLs.

- Streaming availability (JustWatch)
	- Lookup where a movie/series is available to stream in the configured region.
	- Example: `/ott <title>` → streaming platforms and purchase/rent options.

- Backdrops & posters (TMDB)
	- Fetch official backdrops and poster art from TMDB for titles.
	- Example: `/posters <title>` → poster (portrait) and backdrop (landscape) links.

- OTT poster scraping (best-effort)
	- Attempt to fetch posters/landscapes directly from major OTT sites (Amazon, Netflix, Zee5, SonyLiv, Apple TV, Aha, Crunchyroll, BookMyShow). Results vary by site and region.

## How it works

User messages or commands route to handler modules. Handlers invoke:

- Shortener resolver and host extractors
- Site-specific scrapers and challenge solvers
- Telegram file APIs for media processing
- yt-dlp for YouTube extraction
- TMDB and JustWatch for title data

Responses are formatted as direct links, metadata blocks, images, or edited files delivered via Telegram messages with inline previews, attachments, or edited media.

## Architecture at a glance

- Core components: shortener resolver, host extractor, Telegram media processor, yt-dlp integration, TMDB and JustWatch API clients, site-specific scrapers.
- Thumbnail extraction/replacement: Telegram file APIs + Pillow/ffmpeg.
- Anti-bot handling: combination of headless automation and specialized scraping layers (best-effort where sites enforce strict protections).

## Tech stack

- Async/runtime: uvloop, aiohttp, websockets, aiofiles
- Telegram & crypto: pyrofork (Pyrogram fork), tgcrypto, pycryptodome, cryptography
- Datastore & IO: motor (MongoDB async driver)
- Scraping & browser automation: cloudscraper, cfscrape, curl-cffi, requests, urllib3<2, playwright, lxml_html_clean, bs4
- Cloudflare/challenge handling: cloudscraper, playwright, cfscrape, curl-cffi (combined strategies)
- Media & image processing: pillow, ffmpeg (invoked via subprocess)
- YouTube extraction: yt-dlp (subprocess or wrapper)
- Third-party wrappers & helpers: simple-justwatch-python-api, pycountry, html-telegraph-poster
- Utilities & compatibility: requests/httpx patterns, urllib3 compatibility shims

## Hosting

The bot is typically hosted in Docker containers on a VPS for reliable uptime and isolated dependency management. Runtime is orchestrated via Docker with service monitoring.

## Security & privacy

- Files are not permanently stored unless explicitly configured; temporary caching is used for processing.
- Users are responsible for copyright compliance; the bot provides metadata and links only.
- API quotas and rate limits apply; aggressive usage may be throttled or blocked.
